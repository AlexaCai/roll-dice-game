          Each player must accumulate as many points as possible.

          The first player to reach a total of 100 points wins the game.

        <li>
          During their turn, each player can roll the dice as many times as desired, and accumulate points accordingly,
          as
          long as the number obtained is superior to 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          The points are calculated by adding the result obtained on each dice roll to the previous amount of points
          cumulated.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player rolls a 1, all the points accumulated by this player in the round are lost and the turn passes to
          the
          next player.
        </li>
        <li>
          When players wish to save their points because they believe they will roll a 1 shortly, they can stop their
          turn, keep their accumulated points, and pass the dice to the next player.
